## Movie Recommendation System
## Project Overview
This project involves building a movie recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their preferences. The system leverages collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid methods to recommend movies.

## Technologies Used
Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy
Surprise library (for collaborative filtering)
Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization
## Dataset
The dataset used is the MovieLens dataset, which contains millions of movie ratings by users. It includes user IDs, movie titles, genres, and ratings.
The dataset can be downloaded from MovieLens.
## Key Features
Collaborative Filtering: Using user-item interactions (ratings) to suggest movies based on similar users or similar items.
Content-Based Filtering: Recommending movies based on metadata such as genres, keywords, and user preferences.
Hybrid Approach: Combining both collaborative and content-based filtering to improve the quality of recommendations.
Evaluation: Evaluating the recommendation system using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and Precision@K.
## How to Run
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/geethapriyan1692/movie-recommendation-system.git
Install dependencies: Navigate to the cloned directory and install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter Notebook: Open the movie_recommendation_system.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to load data, build the recommendation model, and evaluate it.

## Dataset: Download the MovieLens dataset and place it in the data/ folder. You can use any of the available versions, such as MovieLens 100K, 1M, or 10M.

## Results
The hybrid recommendation system outperformed both collaborative and content-based filtering models. The system achieved an RMSE of 0.89 and demonstrated significant improvements in generating personalized recommendations for users.

## Future Improvements
Incorporating deep learning models, such as Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF), for better performance.
Allowing users to give feedback and further refine recommendations based on interactions.
Expanding the dataset with more user-specific attributes, such as watch history or demographics.
