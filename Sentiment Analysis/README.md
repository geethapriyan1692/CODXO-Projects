## Twitter Sentiment Analysis
## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and classifying the sentiment of tweets into positive, negative, or neutral. The goal is to provide insights into public opinions on various topics by analyzing the emotions expressed in tweets.

## Technologies Used
Python
Tweepy for accessing the Twitter API
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for text preprocessing
Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization
## Dataset
The dataset is gathered from Twitter using the Tweepy API. It consists of tweets labeled by sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).
Features include the text of the tweet, the date it was posted, and user information (optional).
## Key Features
Data Collection: Using Tweepy to collect real-time tweet data based on hashtags or topics.
Text Preprocessing: Cleaning the text by removing special characters, URLs, stop words, and applying tokenization and lemmatization.
Feature Extraction: Using TF-IDF or Bag of Words for vectorizing the cleaned text data.
Modeling: Building models like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify tweet sentiments.
Evaluation: Evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
## How to Run
## Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/geethapriyan1692/twitter-sentiment-analysis.git
## Install dependencies: Navigate to the cloned directory and install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt



## Dataset: you can use pre-collected datasets from sources like Kaggle or create your own through the Tweepy API.

## Results
The Naive Bayes classifier achieved the best accuracy of 85% in this project, with TF-IDF vectorization producing the most significant results. The model effectively captured sentiments with minimal false classifications.

## Future Improvements
Implementing deep learning models like LSTM or transformers to improve sentiment classification accuracy.
Adding more sentiment categories such as "very positive" or "very negative" for granular sentiment analysis.
Expanding the dataset by collecting more tweets to improve model generalization.
